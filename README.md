## Installation
clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/eyalmichon/WhatsappBot.git
```
then inside the project folder use the following command to install required packages:
```
npm install
```
next, you'll need to create a sender file in [.hjson](https://hjson.github.io/) format (exactly the same as JSON but much better!) which you can use to save your group/private numbers safely without being part of the code.

## Running & Usage

```
npm start
```
scan the QR code and wow, you're done!
